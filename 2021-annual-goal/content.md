First of all, thank you for teaching me work norms and help to understand workplace realities. It has always influenced me deeply by the philosophy of results-driven sustainable delivery, keeping it in my mind that tasks should be productive.

Technology endows research and development efficiency; Management allocates resources reasonably; Business extends to the market to creates value and obtain benefits.
